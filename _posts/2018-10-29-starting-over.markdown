I told myself I would sleep early tonight. It's 3AM on a Monday. I have class at 8. And I have [\"Rain King\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izeDRfkyMAQ) by Counting Crows on infinite repeat.

But some things you just need to get done. You need to finish. I'm the type of person who **_needs_** to finish something once I start it. Poor timing on my part, I started migrating my personal website over to Jekyll this past weekend and it took me until 3AM today to nearly complete my migration.

For those who don't know what Jekyll is – [Jekyll is a static-site generator](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it is **amazing**. It uses [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki), YAML, HTML, and CSS to generate static websites. It's a _really_ powerful tool. Is there something better out there? Probably. There's always new technologies out there. But this is what I found and so this is what I'll use, and I love it.

I won't get too much into the details about Jekyll – I'll probably write a blog post about it later.

I'm halfway through my junior fall and I've decided I needed to restart some things \(this website included\). I'm in a bit of a mid-college crisis – if that's even a thing. I realized that my time at University at Buffalo is more than halfway over and I have less than two years before I enter the **\"real world\"**. Am I scared? Nervous? A little bit.

But I find myself a little behind. Not on classes. Not on my careers. But on my own goals. Before I entered college, senior-year me had a bucket list of things for me to accomplish before the end of college. As I entered college, I was confident I would accomplish all of these things. Now, sitting in my apartment in junior year, I am unsure. I got so wrapped up in my classes, searching for jobs, that I lost track of the goals I had set out in the first place.

I want to redirect my focus. Redirect my energy towards the things I wanted to do in the first place. And here are the things I want to accomplish.

### Exercise

I'm a skinny dude. It's a consensus among all my peers. I'm a 5\'4\" Filipino guy who weighs in at about 112 lbs. I haven't changed my weight since high school. Even some days when I would forget to eat a meal or two I would even dip below my weight in high school. In senior year, I told myself I would fix this, and two years later I'm still at the same state. I have a gym membership that I need to maximize, so from now on I'll be making time for my physical health at the gym.

Not just exercise but eating more. I've been a picky eater my whole life, and even worse I would never finish my food. Now that I have the freedom to cook whatever I want, hopefully I can at least put on a few pounds from my own cooking. All I need to do is find recipes that I would enjoy and then make them. I recently found a [recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1hxr1w/spicesrub_to_add_to_plain_chicken/cayynyc/) for chicken with a spice rub and I can't stop cooking it. So I just need to find more and I am set!

### Reading

With the amount of assignments, homework, and projects I have to work on, I neglected saving some time for my own reading. I absolutely love reading, experiencing new perspectives, learning new things. I know that I am attending college for my education but that education shouldn't be confined to just my classes – there are millions of books out there just waiting to be read! At the beginning of 2018 I started off reading some books, and once the semester began again, these books were left alone. I recently sparked my love again with reading, so I make sure to keep at least one book in my backpack at all times so that I can read. It _does_ look better with my nose in a book than staring at my phone, at least I look productive when I'm reading!

So far these are the books I have read this year:

* _Where You Go is Not Who You'll Be_ by Frank Bruni
* _The Overachievers_ by Alexandra Robbins
* _The Disaster Artist_ by Greg Sestero
* _The Suble Art of Not Giving a F\*ck_ by Mark Manson
* _Educated_ by Tara Westover

I am currently in the process of getting through _The Power of Habit_ by Charles Duhigg. The next book on my reading list is _Quiet_ by Susan Cain.

### Sleep

This is the one thing I need to work one. This is the one thing I am violating just by writing this blog post. I need to fix my sleep schedule. It has been an issue since high school - I don't remember the last time I slept before 12AM. It has become normal for me to sleep at 3AM and even though I am a night person, I need to wake up early to get to class. I find myself more aware and productive throughout the day when I get a good night's sleep, so I definitely need to work on this. I began by installing f.lux on my MacBook and turning off the lights in my bedroom around 10PM each evening. Does it work? Not really but at least it gets me tired.

I find that when I list out the things I need to get done, I'm more likely to do them. And now, when I'm publicizing it for the world to see, I'm even **more** likely to do them. I wanted to have my own blog for the longest time, just to spill my thoughts, share them with others. And what better way than to write a website and create a blog that allows me to do that? 

If you're still reading this, I applaud you. I'm not a writer, but I'll write. I'm no J.K. Rowling or Kurt Vonnegut, but I still want to share my thoughts. This is the first post of many, and the new start of my personal website, and hopefully a new start for me.
