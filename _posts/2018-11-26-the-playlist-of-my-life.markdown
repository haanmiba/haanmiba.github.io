I've decided to consolidate a few things, namely my music playlists. With dozens of playlists built up over the years and thousands of songs on my Spotify, I find myself spending more time hitting the 'Next Song' button than actually listening to my music.

I first attempted to consolidate my songs by my most played artists/songs on Spotify. Unfortunately, Spotify does not keep track of how many plays each song has. Luckily, I found a [link](http://107.170.81.187:8080/public/top) on Reddit that lists your top Spotify artists and songs.

This link certainly helped, however as I went through it I realized how much my music tastes have changed over time. My old music phases from high school resurfaced – my EDM phase, that one month I listened to Iron Maiden, and that one year where I thought I was "woke" because I listened exclusively to indie rock.

There was a lot of deviations from my current music taste when going through my top artists and songs through the link, so I went down a different approach. I went through my playlists on Spotify and played each song one at a time. If I made it to the end, then this song would make it to a new playlist that was titled "The Playlist of My Life". I was watching a few [YouTube videos from Vogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1-03zTcACg&list=PLXQ-B69QR-5MXzj2l11OvFRw-Z26_o2QO) of popular artists and celebrities doing this on Vogue and it really made me wonder which songs I would consider of large importance in my life, so here it is.

### 1. ["Rain King"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=izeDRfkyMAQ) by Counting Crows
> _I belong in the service of the queen_

I first began hearing Counting Crows when they were writing songs for Shrek – I didn't know that they actually made music outside of Shrek. I heard "Rain King" play for the first time at the Walden Galleria near my university and I fell in love with Adam Duritz's way of singing it. There is a constant swell and dip and swell with this song that really picks up during the chorus and it just makes me happy listening to it.

### 2. ["I've Seen All Good People"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJM7TdshUbw) by Yes
> _'Cause it's time, it's time in time with your time_

I actually found this song quite recently – yesterday actually. I was in my car in my hometown about to drive back to Buffalo since my Thanksgiving break was ending. The song came up on the local classic rock radio station and the 70's vocals and background acoustics really boosted my mood for the rest of my 8-hour drive that day. Technically this song is split up into two sections: a) Your Move and b) All Good People. I absolutely love part a more than part b but the entire song is still really good. It sounds like it belongs as the ending credits of a Wes Anderson movie.

### 3. ["Tyson vs Douglas"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zgwf0mswh_4) by The Killers
> _When I saw him go down, felt like somebody lied_

Mr. Brightside and Spaceman were my all-time favorite songs by The Killers until The Killer released their newest album _Wonderful Wonderful_. Brandon Flowers' vocals absolutely shine and emote the feelings of watching your idol, your hero fall. "Tyson vs Douglas" is a song about growing up, realizing that the people you look up to, whether they be an athlete, your parents, your teachers, realizing that they are human and imperfect. Everyone fails at one point or another. And at some point, every child will realize that adults aren't all-knowing, all-perfect beings that are free of hardship and failure. They fall too because to fall is to be human.

### 4. ["Take on Me"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV11Xbc914) by a-ha
> _Take on me..._

Funny enough there is no real significance or meaning to this song for me. I absolutely love this song because "Take on Me" is my favorite music video of all time. The fact that every frame had to be hand-drawn and put together is a feat in and of itself and I find myself watching it every now and then.

### 5. ["Under Pressure"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a01QQZyl-_I) by Queen & David Bowie
> _Why can't we give love, give love, give love..._

So I heard "Ice Ice Baby" by Vanilla Ice before ever hearing "Under Pressure", and I wasn't the biggest fan of "Ice Ice Baby" so it took me a while to get into "Under Pressure". However the vocals absolutely took hold of me. The song's climax near the end jumped it to the top of my playlists – I would always make sure that "Under Pressure" played first.

### 6. ["No Surprises"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5CVsCnxyXg) by Radiohead
> _This is my final fit..._

Cathartic is the word I would use to describe "No Surprises". My second-favorite music video of all time behind "Take on Me". "No Surprises" for me is about accepting the mind-numbing routine that many adults encounter in life. No surprises because every day is the same. How death is the only release from this routine. However if one can find contentment and happiness in their life, this routine wouldn't be so bad.

### 7. ["Khe Sanh"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTjvG4WJD_A) by Cold Chisel
> _Well the last plane out of Sydney's almost gone_

There isn't much to say about "Khe Sanh" other than it is my favorite song about the Vietnam War. Not only that but it is the only Vietnam War song I've heard come from Australia. It is a significant symbol of Austrialian culture during the Vietnam War and hearing the War from their perspective.

### 8. ["The Longest Time"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUl4kxTfzKE) by Billy Joel
> _I intend to hold you for the longest time_

I'm a Long Islander, of course I need one song by Billy Joel. "The Longest Time"'s acapella style makes it stand out from the rest of Billy Joel's songs, which is why it is my favorite song by him. Unfortunately he does not perform it live too often, but it still stands as my favorite song from Joel.

### 9. ["Step"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mDxcDjg9P4) by Vampire Weekend
> _The gloves are off, the wisdom teeth are out_

For a while I never heard any song come out of Vampire Weekend other than "Unbelievers". However I found "Step" through a YouTube video and its mellow melody and soothing vocals put me in a peaceful trance that many other songs do not.

### 10. ["Throwing It All Away"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz8LK3Dum84) by Genesis
> _Who'll find you the answers, when you don't understand_

Phil Collins sounds like autotune if autotune was a thing in the 1980's, but this song by Genesis makes me of driving through the mountains in New York. Of all the songs in this list, I found this song with my best friend during our senior year of high school. At the time I was still pretty dependent on my parents, I lived under their roof, I never drove off of Long Island before. College was coming soon and I wanted to change many things about myself, to grow up. To adventure off and see how I could fare being by myself in an unfamiliar environment. I heard this song again a few years later, when I was off living at college, when I make regular drives across New York State. I thought to myself, "would high-school me be happy with where I am now? The choices I've made? The people I've lost and the people I've met since I left Long Island?" And I said yes.
