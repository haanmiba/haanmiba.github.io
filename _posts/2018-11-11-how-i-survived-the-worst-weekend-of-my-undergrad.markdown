Okay all jokes aside, I **did** survive the worst week of my undergraduate career \(so far\). So you may be asking – *why* was this the worst week of my undergrad? Well, simply – everything was due at and around the same time. Homeworks were due, projects were due, midterms were happening, all my friends wanted to hang out, there were events happening on campus I wanted to go to – it was quite overwhelming! So this blog post is simply to reflect on this week and what I learned.

### The Week: Monday, October 29 – Sunday, November 4

**_DISCLAIMER: This is the worst week in MY undergraduate career. I can definitely guaranatee that there are people with worse weeks but this is a reflection on mine._**

Now I am a firm believer that I can survive pressure and deadlines. I have been doing it for the last two years of undergrad. I've never handed in anything late, I don't get zeroes, and I usually do at least a decent job. However this week was simply a choosing game. What do I mean by that? Let's look at what I have to do this week:

Monday, October 29:
* CSE 331 \(Algorithm Design\) – Group Video Project on Deep Neural Networks

Thursday, November 1:
* CSE 331 \(Algorithm Design\) – Homework Analyzing Algorithm on Interval Scheduling

Friday, November 2:
* EAS 360 \(STEM Communications\) – White Paper/Recommendation Report

Saturday, November 3:
* PHY 118 \(Physics II – Electromagnetism\) – Midterm II on Circuits
* [UB Hacking](https://www.ubhacking.com/)!!
* END 285 \(Transportation & Urban Planning\) – Project on Road Design
* END 285 \(Transportation & Urban Planning\) – Quiz on Road Design

Sunday, November 4:
* *[Fiddler on the Roof](https://www.sheas.org/performances/fiddler-on-the-roof/)* with friends!
* PHY 118 \(Physics II – Electromagnetism\) – Textbook Homework on Magnetic Fields Caused by Circuits

#### Monday

The week honestly began just fine. Monday is my lightest day of the week – I don't TA, I don't have office hours, and I _usually_ don't have something due. However, that night my CSE 331 class on algorithms had a video project due. At the beginning of the semester we chose groups and we had to create a video detailing an algorithm and its impact on society. Monday night I went over to my friend's apartment and we recorded ourselves talking over Google Slides about YouTube's Deep Neural Network it uses for recommendations.

We got the project complete over the course of just four hours, so it honestly wasn't that bad. Little did I know this video project would be the **_least_** of my worries.

#### Thursday

So naïve me believed that this would be similar to all my other weeks, except with just some extra work, extra deadlines. 

The first of many mistakes that I made is by beginning the week by working on the wrong assignment. One of the major projects that I had this semester was a White Paper/Recommendation report for STEM Communications \(EAS 360\), where I wrote an entire research report analyzing traffic that happens along the John James Audubon Roundabout near the University at Buffalo campus.

Now the mistake began when I looked at the due date for my white paper. I mistakenly thought that when it was due by Friday, November 2nd, I thought that it was due 11:59PM the previous night, meaning it was actually due Thursday night. So I spent the majority of my day working on my white paper, neglecting my algorithms homework due that night. I could've spent the next day working on my white paper but since the white paper was worth more points than my algos homework, I decided to work on and complete my white paper instead, leaving me only a few hours to complete my algos homework due at 11:59PM Thursday night.

My Algos class \(CSE 331\) is easily my favorite class this semester. Since I'm also a math major and the class emphasizes heavily on proofs, this class was really exciting and interesting for me. It really challenges me to think of new ways to solve problems that computer scientists and software engineers have been trying to tackle since the computer was created. Not just to think of new ways and new algorithms but to prove that they are correct. There's a certain language that comes to writing and reading proofs, a language that is intricate and beautiful. Every detail analyzed, edge cases considered, proving that your algorithm will work no matter what.

The downside is that this language is **really long**.

There is a coding portion of the class that is honestly not too bad, but it only accounts for a small portion of the homework grade. The bulk of our points come from the proofs we have to write, and I *truly* underestimated how long the proofs for this week were going to be. Due to me working all day on my white paper, I was only granted a few hours to write my proofs for this week's homework on interval scheduling.

*\(The irony is that the interval scheduling homework from algos stated that the most optimal way to perform tasks with deadline is to do them in order by whatever is due first to whatever is due last. However I did my EAS white paper before my interval scheduling homework. So lesson learned.\)*

At 11:57PM I finished my proofs, converted it to PDF, and handed it in just before the deadline. Did I complete it? Yes but I definitely could have done a better job had I had more time.

#### Friday

So I found out in EAS that the white paper was indeed due tonight at midnight. So I definitely could have used today to work on it rather than yesterday and completed my Algos homework with more time. But the past is in the past and I can only move forward. But I had another thing to worry about that night:

Physics.

Now I _loved_ physics. Emphasis on past-tense _loved_. I took physics in high school, I had an amazing physics teacher and he taught me so many life lessons about passion and being true to oneself, and he instilled in me a love of learning and love of understanding how the universe works around me. \(Shoutout Mr. Lundquist!\)

Physics still works to spark my interest – it's the language of how the Universe works and why it works and I will always have that part of me that loves physics.

But I have my fair share of issues with the University at Buffalo's physics department. I will not go into detail for it but I had a complete **_awful_** experience with a certain physics professor my sophomore spring semester that almost made me hate the subject. Needless to say I have yet to meet a person in the physics department with even a portion of the passion that my high school teacher had, it actually made me a bit indifferent towards the subject seeing how these faculty members are primarily focused on their research and only think of their students second.

Without going too deep into my issues with the physics department, I must admit that I am not doing too well in physics. I am not failing but I am not performing to the best of my ability either. I excelled at Physics I \(Kinematics\), but electromagnetism was always my weak spot, and I even knew this in high school.

To add salt to the wound I had a physics midterm Saturday morning at **8 AM** \(thanks, physics department\) and I **_had_** to do well. How would I do this?

I skipped class.

Looking back at it, it was kind of funny – I skipped physics to study for physics, but I absolutely needed to study. I needed to understand everything that was happening in class for the past month since I was in a perpetual state of confusion when it came to electromagnetism. Not only that, but since each chapter in electromagnetism was simply an extension of the previous chapter, and I didn't do too well on the first midterm, this would mean that **I need to study everything from the first midterm as well**.

So for the hours of 3PM to 3AM, the next 12 hours was spent cramming and studying for physics. Resistance, capacitance, current, magnetism, **everything**.

By the time 3AM hit, I had finally understood everything that was happening in class. Everything connected. But my exam was in five hours. I prompty went to sleep for a few hours.

#### Saturday

My physics exam went quite well. We were given an equation sheet but since I studied extremely hard I barely looked at it, only looking at it for metric unit conversions.

After my physics exam I went on to go attend UB Hacking, the University at Buffalo's annual hackathon. I considered the hackathon a break, something that I can do **for fun** rather than for a grade. I'm not a competitive person so I usually take the time at UB Hacking to learn something I didn't learn before – and I'd essentially spend my time developing a web app with Python Flask, Imgur API, developing a REST API, and databases. \(I hope to make a separate blog post in the future detailing my experience with UB Hacking and what I learned in the near future.\)

However I had my transportation \(END 285\) project and quiz due that night. Honestly my transportation class was probably the least of my priorities – it was an online class and I only took it for UB Pathways \(general curriculum\) and because I liked _Cities: Skylines_. So this project promptly took away a few hours I could have spent coding for the hackathon – I had to design my own street and write an essay about my design and take a quiz. This was all due at 11:59PM Saturday night, just as I was figuring out how to work databases for my web app. I was able to get all of the work done in just under an hour and I submitted at 11:59PM on the dot.

Now since it was a 24-hour hackathon, and I was heavily invested in my project, I didn't sleep that night. I went back to my apartment and spent the night learning how to connect my Python Flask/REST API backend to a database so I can set up logins and accounts on my web app.

#### Sunday

Sunday morning I was still awake. I reached a state of faux-awakeness where I believed I would be fine for the rest of the day. I was going to make it right? I went back to the hackathon, presented the web app I created, and I left. Honestly this was the most eventful UB Hacking I have been to – I learned so much about back end and working with databases that I am excited for the next project I create with my new knowledge.

That afternoon two of my friends and I drove to downtown Buffalo \(I wasn't driving\) to watch _Fiddler on the Roof_ at Shea's Theater. This was where my body would take its revenge on me. I was awake up until the first dance number, 'Tradition', but immediately after I fell asleep for the majority of Act I. I was pretty upset since I was really looking forward to seeing _Fiddler_. I was awake for the entirety of Act II though, and I had a fun time with my friends despite me not knowing the plot since I missed Act I. Not only that but _Fiddler_ without a doubt has the best bows I have ever seen in any musical, so I was happy to experience it as the first musical I have seen at Shea's Theater.

When I got home that I absolutely crashed. I came to a realization that my weekend was already over and that I would have class again the next morning so I did not want to continue doing any work. I laid in my bed at 7PM and slept until 9:30AM the next day. The worst weekend of my undergrad career was over. And I survived.

#### What I Learned

The first thing I learned was from the interval scheduling homework form Algos: **_work on things in order of their deadline__*. It's a way to minimize lateness and ensure that tasks get mostly done.

From the hackathon I learned so much about Flask, REST APIs, databases, and creating web applications in general. I'll definitely continue learning more about these topics but I am happy to say that I was able to create a basic web application.

Lastly, I learned that above all, sleep and your own health is important. Falling asleep in random places \(at a musical of all places!\) is the result of a poor sleep schedule and I have a bad history with damaging my own. It all comes down to working on a schedule and pacing yourself rather than let deadlines catch up all at once. I am still learning to accept that I can begin assignments and simply work on them in small amounts rather than all at once just before they are due.

Above it all I survived. What I thought would be a neverending week actually ended, and my schedule is back to normal. No matter how overwhelming college gets, each mountain of workload eventually has its peak and falling slope. It is all a challenge of learning what to prioritize and managing your time. But in the end you're always learning. And that's all that matters, right?
